### Credit

This library is created mostly by Christopher Pilkington.   
For the parts that are not mine, I try to keep an up to date list of any third party libraries that I use.   
I only use libraries that are license under either the GPL or similar and am eternally grateful for the high quality ease of use and generosity of the open source community.
